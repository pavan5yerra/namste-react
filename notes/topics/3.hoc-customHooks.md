***Comparison - HOC vs Custom Hooks***

>- ***Purpose***: HOCs are primarily used for enhancing components with cross-cutting concerns, while Custom Hooks are used for encapsulating and reusing logic within components.
>- ***Composition vs. Encapsulation***: HOCs focus on composition by wrapping components, while Custom Hooks focus on encapsulation by extracting logic into reusable functions.
>- ***Flexibility***: HOCs can be more flexible in terms of manipulating props and composing multiple enhancements, while Custom Hooks are more focused on encapsulating specific logic.
>- ***Syntax***: Custom Hooks are regular JavaScript functions, while HOCs are functions that return a new component.
>- ***Dependency Injection***: HOCs can inject props into components, while Custom Hooks are not capable of doing this directly.
>- ***Readability***: Custom Hooks can lead to more readable and understandable code by encapsulating logic, while HOCs can sometimes make the component hierarchy less clear due to multiple layers of wrapping.

***In summary, HOCs and Custom Hooks serve similar purposes in terms of reusability and abstraction, but they have different implementations and are suitable for different use cases. HOCs are more suitable for enhancing components with cross-cutting concerns, while Custom Hooks are more suitable for encapsulating and reusing logic within components.***
