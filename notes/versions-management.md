The concept of "subversions" generally refers to the granularity of version numbers in software versioning. Semantic Versioning (SemVer) is a widely adopted versioning scheme that uses a three-part number format: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. Each part of the version number represents a different level of change, and subversions can be thought of as more detailed versions within these categories.

### Semantic Versioning (SemVer)
According to SemVer, the version number is structured as follows:

- **MAJOR**: Increments indicate incompatible API changes.
- **MINOR**: Increments indicate backward-compatible functionality has been added.
- **PATCH**: Increments indicate backward-compatible bug fixes.
**Example: **`**1.2.3**` 

- `1`  is the MAJOR version.
- `2`  is the MINOR version.
- `3`  is the PATCH version.
### Detailed Version Ranges
While SemVer itself doesn't provide more granularity beyond `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, you can specify more detailed constraints using version ranges and pre-release identifiers.

#### Pre-release Versions
Pre-release versions can be used to indicate that a version is not stable and is intended for testing. These are denoted by appending a hyphen and a series of dot-separated identifiers.

**Example: **`**1.2.3-alpha.1**` 

- `alpha` , `beta` , `rc`  (release candidate) are common identifiers.
#### Build Metadata
Build metadata can be appended to the version using a plus sign. This is used to indicate build-specific information.

**Example: **`**1.2.3+build.123**` 

### Practical Examples
Here's an example `package.json` illustrating various version ranges:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "exact-version": "1.2.3",    ---> 1.2.3
    "caret-version": "^1.2.3",  --> allows minor and patches [1.2.4 , 1.3.0] 
    "tilde-version": "~1.2.3",   --> allows patches [1.2.4 , 1.2.5]
    "greater-than-version": ">1.2.3", -->  covers any version of range greater than 1.2.3
    "less-than-version": "<1.2.3",   --> covers any version of range less than 1.2.3
    "greater-than-equal-version": ">=1.2.3", --> covers any version of range greater than  = 1.2.3
    "less-than-equal-version": "<=1.2.3",     --> covers any version of range less than  = 1.2.3
    "range-version": "1.2.3 - 1.2.5",
    "logical-and-version": ">1.2.3 <2.0.0",
    "logical-or-version": "<1.0.0 || >=2.0.0",
    "wildcard-version": "1.2.x",     --> covers any patch version   
    "pre-release-version": "1.2.3-alpha.1",
    "build-metadata-version": "1.2.3+build.123"
  }
}
```
